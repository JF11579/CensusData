## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Loadoad your census key census_api_key("6eff16100e6184b9bf0604e510aeba4abcdefghij,install = TRUE,overwrite = TRUE)

 The Census Dept surveys the entire nation every 10 years but in between they do estimates 
called THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY or ACS.  The ACS comes in 1yr,3yr,5yr versions.
All communities get a 5yr ACS but only communities of 200,000 + get 1yr.

That was the WHEN next we will look at the WHERE.

From smallest to largest:cencus block, cencus block groups, 
censuc tracts.
These are nested.
The smaller the unit the greater the MOE (maargin of error)

Census blocks have 0 to several hundred.
Block groups have 600 to 3,000 people.
Block groups dont cross county or state boundaries.
Block Group is the smallest unit for which the cencus publishes.

Census Tracts deliniated by locals,1500 to 8000. Each county has at least one,i.e,
Tracts dont cross county boundaries.  Aspire to be homogenous re 
economics.  Tract boundaries are rarely changed to make before after comparrison meaningfull.


A search with TidyCensus  of  the 10 year census is done like this:
States_Population<- get_decennial (geography= "state", year=2010, variable= "P001001")
Besides "state" and "nation" , on can alsp search block, groupd block, zcta, (which is not identical
zip code but the Census bureau tells me is very close) and county.
But now lets run that search

States_Population<- get_decennial (geography= "state", year=2010, variable= "P001001")
dim(States_Population)

#There are a LOT of variables.  3,346 to be prec

```{r}
decenial_census_variables<- load_variables(2010, "sf1", cache = TRUE)
dim(decenial_census_variables)
```

What if we wanted to know the popuilation of every single county in the US?  Easy.
County_Population<- get_decennial (geography= "county", year=2010, variable= "P001001")
dim(County_Population)
```{r}
County_Population<- get_decennial (geography= "county", year=2010, variable= "P001001")

```


```{r}
kable(head(County_Population))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

#Rather amazing  In under 100 key strokes one now has the population of every coounty in the US.

#But what if you are only interested in single state?

NY_Counties_Pop<- get_decennial(geography = "county", year = 2010, state = "NY",
                             variables = "P001001")
dim(NY_Counties_Pop)
```{r}
NY_Counties_Pop<- get_decennial(geography = "county", year = 2010, state = "NY",
                             variables = "P001001")

```

```{r}
kable(head(NY_Counties_Pop))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```


But all of this is from the 2010 census.  For more recent data ,albeit from  an estimate rather than
a survey, one can use the American Community Survey (ACS).

First let us look at the  variables of the ACS.
There are a lot of them.  Over 25,000 variables

```{r}
ACS5_variables_2017<- load_variables(2017,"acs5",cache = TRUE)
dim(ACS5_variables_2017)
```

So how does one find the variable one is looking for ?

```{r}
View(ACS5_variables_2017)
```


In the top right corner of the ACS_Variables_2017 is a search box.
This is a trial by error with the emphais on the error, tilting towards exasperation at times.
Enter MARRIED.
B06008_002 is "Estimate!!Total!!Never married". I was surprised that this was a criteria.
But then again there are 25,000+ variables.


When  we run the next line it will tell us how many people have never been married in each 
congressional district.  If one is not sure why this would be usefull think instead of the wonder of 
its spoecificity and assume no matter what demographic deatil one might wish for it, is in
the census (somewhere).


Latino , Sex by Age B01001I_001
```{r}
Never_Married_2017<- get_acs(geography = "congressional district", variables = "B12002C_009",
            year = 2017, state = "NY", geometry = FALSE)
```

```{r}
kable(head(Never_Married_2017))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```


Suppose you wanted to know how many Latinos live in each congressional district in NYS?

```{r}
Latino_NYS_CongressionalDist_Pop<- get_acs(geography = "congressional district", variables = "B01001I_001",
                              year = 2017, state = "NY", geometry = FALSE)
```

```{r}
kable(head(Latino_NYS_CongressionalDist_Pop))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

But we can also just as easliy drill down and find the age distribution for that same population.
But here we change the technique a bit.
First we drop the suffix from the variable name. "B01001I" instead of  "B01001I_001".  This 
coupled with exchanging "Variables = " for "table= "calls up not the specific file
but the entire group.  Lastly specify "output= "wide" " to make each age group acolumn.

Latino_NYS_ConDist_Age_Dist<- get_acs(geography = "congressional district",state = "NY",
                                   table="B01001I", output = "wide",survey = "acs5")
```{r}
Latino_NYS_ConDist_Age_Dist<- get_acs(geography = "congressional district",state = "NY",
                                   table="B01001I", output = "wide",survey = "acs5")
```


```{r}
kable(head(Latino_NYS_CongressionalDist_Pop))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```



The output is just what one would hope for.
Each row is the congressional district and each column is the age bracket.
To decode the age brackets return to the ACS5 object, enter Latino, and scroll down
until one gets to B010001I
B01001I_002 is total male population.
B01001I_003Estimate!!Total!!Male!!Under 5 years
B01001I_004Estimate!!Total!!Male!!5 to 9 years

#And so on .  How marvelously specif is this?
